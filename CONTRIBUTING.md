# Contributing

First of all, Â¡Thank you for your contribution! :)

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant 1.3. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to dt@atrapalo.com.

## Contributing to the code base

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.

Before proposing a pull request, check the following:

* Your code should follow the [PSR-2 coding standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). You can use [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/fabpot/PHP-CS-Fixer) to sniff your code and fix inconsistencies.
* Unit tests should still pass after your patch. Run the tests on your dev server (with the simple `php bin/phpunit`) or check the continuous integration status for your pull request.
* As much as possible, add unit tests for your code
* You SHOULD write documentation.
* Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.?'
* One may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).
* Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Once your code is merged, it is available for free to everybody under the MIT License. Publishing your Pull Request on the this GitHub repository means that you agree with this license for your contribution.

Thank you!
